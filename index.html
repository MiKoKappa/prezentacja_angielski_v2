              prototypes of a usage and only wireframe the app layout, UI
              creates user guides for using the app and makes storylines which
              engage users, but it is not focused on planning strict
              psychological processes when using the product.

            <aside class="notes">
              I would like to split the tools into three groups, based on
              designing steps. The first one is user resarch tools. To better
              know what the user really wants and what he aims for you need to
              survey, interview and find value in gathered data.
